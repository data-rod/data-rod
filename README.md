Hello! I'm a forest engineering Ph.D. student with a focus on remote sensing and environmental analysis. I'm interested in developing complex models for geospatial data analysis, such as the Random Forest model, and exploring advanced geoprocessing techniques.

## Education
- Ph.D. in Forest Science 
- M.Sc. in Forest Science
- B.Sc. in Forest Engineering 

## Projects
- **Geospatial Data Modeling:** Developing model for analyzing land use patterns in forested areas.
- **Analysis of Forest Habitat Persistence:** Study on the persistence of forest habitats in temporal series of satellite images.

Feel free to reach out to me to discuss collaborations or interesting projects in the field of remote sensing and environmental analysis!
